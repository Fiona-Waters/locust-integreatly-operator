# locust integreatly operator

This repo contains code to do load testing on the integreatly-operator.

## Recommendation
This repo currently will work with python 3.9 or better but the recommended version is python 3.11 or higher. 

## Configuration Files
There are three configuration formats that are accepted. 
Examples of these files can be found in the [configuration_samples](./configuration_samples) folder.

The toml configuration format is the recommended format but requires python 3.11 or higher to be parsed.
New configuration options will be added to the toml format only.

Json format has being included as alternative to the csv format.

The csv format is a historical artifact from using the hyperfoil test suite. 
This file can have two names `rhsso_auth.csv` or `auth.csv`.
Support for csv will be removed once python 3.11 is the minium support version.

| Format | Filename(s)              |
|--------|--------------------------|
| toml   | config.toml              |
| json   | auth.json                |
| csv    | rhsso_auth.csv, auth.csv |

Which ever file format is used the configuration file needs to be placed in the same location as the `locustfile.py`. 

 
## Run load test with remote host
Log into a remote instances and insure the following tooling is installed
```shell
sudo dnf install python3.11 -y
pip3.11 install locust
mkdir locust
```

From the local machine copy the source files.
```shell
scp -i ~/.ssh/some_key.pem -r locust/* ec2-user@<remote.url>:locust
```

After an initial hyperfoil run copy the `rhsso_auth.csv` file from `/tmp/hyperfoil/runs/****/`.

Start locust and the max number of workers supported by the ec2 instances.
```shell
~/locust/start.sh
```

Navigate to the locust UI via http://<remote.url>:8089.
Here you can start the load testing.

After the test have run and test results downloaded, locust can be stopped using `~/locust/kill.sh`

## Develop load test locally

Set local environment to use python 3.11.
Requires 3.11 to be installed but 3.11 does not need to be the system default version.
```shell
poetry env use 3.11
```

Set up the local environment using poetry.
```shell
poetry install
```

If you are wishing not to use the mock server you can set up the environment using.
```shell
poetry install --no-dev
```

As the `config.toml` file is required there is a sample file that will work with the mock server.
```shell
cp configuration_samples/sample_config.toml locust/config.toml
```

Active the mock server if needed.
```shell
poetry run uvicorn --reload mock_server.main:app
```

Start an instance of locust.
```shell
cd locust
poetry run locust
```
